    "In week 2, we learned that sequencing reads are stored in `FASTQ` files. During this week's lecture, we learned that, typically, the results of sequencing read alignment to a reference genome (e.g., the human reference genome) are stored in a Sequence Alignment/Map `SAM` file. In this exercise, we learn about this format and use JupyterLab's *Terminal* as well as some Unix/Linux commands to inspect a SAM file (i.e., `ezh2.sam` that can be found in the `~/BBT_021_Bioinformatics/Week_04/` directory)."
